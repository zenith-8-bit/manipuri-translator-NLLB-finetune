The word index is a list that maps unique words to specific numerical identifiers and the tokenized text replaces each word with its corresponding numerical token,ꯋꯥꯍꯩ ꯏꯟꯗꯦꯛꯁ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯑꯀꯛꯅꯕꯥ ꯅ꯭ꯌꯨꯃꯔꯤꯛ ꯑꯥꯏꯗꯦꯟꯇꯤꯐꯥꯌꯔꯁꯤꯡꯗꯥ ꯑꯈꯟꯅꯕꯥ ꯋꯥꯍꯩꯁꯤꯡ ꯃꯦꯞ ꯇꯧꯕꯥ ꯂꯤꯁ꯭ꯠ ꯑꯃꯅꯤ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯇꯣꯀꯦꯟ ꯇꯧꯔꯕꯥ ꯇꯦꯛꯁ ꯑꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯋꯥꯍꯩ ꯈꯨꯗꯤꯡꯃꯛ ꯃꯗꯨꯒꯤ ꯃꯔꯤ ꯂꯩꯅꯕꯥ ꯅ꯭ꯌꯨꯃꯔꯤꯛ ꯇꯣꯀꯦꯟ ꯑꯗꯨꯒꯥ ꯃꯍꯨꯠ ꯁꯤꯜꯂꯤ꯫

However some written languages like Chinese Japanese and Thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language,ꯑꯗꯨꯝ ꯑꯣꯏꯅꯃꯛ ꯆꯥꯏꯅꯥꯒꯤ ꯖꯄꯥꯅꯤꯖ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯊꯥꯏꯂꯦꯟꯗꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯏꯕꯥ ꯂꯣꯜ ꯈꯔꯅꯥ ꯑꯁꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯃꯑꯣꯡꯗꯥ ꯋꯥꯍꯩꯒꯤ ꯉꯃꯈꯩꯁꯤꯡ ꯃꯥꯔꯛ ꯇꯧꯗꯦ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯂꯣꯂꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯇꯦꯛꯁ ꯁꯦꯒꯃꯦꯟꯇ ꯇꯧꯕꯥ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯂꯣꯟꯗꯥ ꯋꯥꯍꯩꯁꯤꯡꯒꯤ ꯋꯥꯍꯩ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯣꯔꯐꯣꯂꯣꯖꯤꯒꯤ ꯃꯇꯥꯡꯗꯥ ꯈꯉꯕꯥ ꯃꯊꯧ ꯇꯥꯕꯥ ꯃꯔꯨ ꯑꯣꯏꯕꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯑꯃꯅꯤ
