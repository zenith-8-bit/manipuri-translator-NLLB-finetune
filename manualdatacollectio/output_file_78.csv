Lexical semantics What is the computational meaning of individual words in context Distributional semantics How can we learn semantic representations from data Named entity recognition NER Given a stream of text determine which items in the text map to proper names such as people or places and what the type of each such name is e.g. person location organization,ꯂꯦꯛꯁꯤꯀꯦꯜ ꯁꯦꯃꯦꯟꯇꯤꯛꯁ ꯀꯟꯇꯦꯛꯁꯇꯥ ꯃꯤꯑꯣꯏ ꯑꯃꯒꯤ ꯋꯥꯍꯩꯁꯤꯡꯒꯤ ꯀꯝꯞꯌꯨꯇꯦꯁ꯭ꯅꯦꯜ ꯃꯤꯅꯤꯡ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯀꯔꯤꯅꯣ ꯍꯥꯌꯕꯗꯨ ꯗꯤꯁ꯭ꯠꯔꯤꯕ꯭ꯌꯨꯁꯅꯦꯜ ꯁꯦꯃꯦꯟꯇꯤꯀꯁꯤꯡꯗꯥ ꯑꯩꯈꯣꯌꯅꯥ ꯇꯦꯛꯁꯀꯤ ꯁ꯭ꯠꯔꯤꯝ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯄꯤꯕꯥ ꯑꯦꯟꯇꯤꯇꯤ ꯔꯤꯀꯣꯒꯅꯤꯁꯟ ꯅꯦꯔ ꯍꯥꯌꯅꯥ ꯃꯃꯤꯡ ꯊꯣꯅꯕꯥ ꯗꯦꯇꯥꯗꯒꯤ ꯁꯦꯃꯦꯟꯇꯤꯛ ꯔꯤꯞꯔꯖꯦꯟꯇꯦꯁꯅꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯀꯔꯝꯅꯥ ꯇꯃꯒꯅꯤ ꯇꯦꯛꯁ ꯃꯦꯄꯇꯥ ꯃꯤꯑꯣꯏ ꯅꯠꯔꯒꯥ ꯃꯐꯃꯁꯤꯡꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯃꯊꯧ ꯇꯥꯕꯥ ꯃꯤꯡꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯑꯁꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯃꯤꯡ ꯈꯨꯗꯤꯡꯃꯛꯀꯤ ꯃꯈꯜ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯏ.ꯖꯤ.
Although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient,ꯀꯦꯄꯤꯇꯦꯂꯥꯏꯖꯦꯁꯟꯅꯥ ꯏꯪꯂꯤꯁꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯂꯣꯂꯁꯤꯡꯗꯥ ꯃꯃꯤꯡ ꯂꯩꯔꯕꯥ ꯑꯦꯟꯇꯤꯇꯤꯁꯤꯡ ꯈꯉꯗꯣꯀꯄꯗꯥ ꯃꯇꯦꯡ ꯄꯥꯡꯕꯥ ꯉꯝꯂꯕꯁꯨ ꯏꯅꯐꯣꯔꯃꯦꯁꯟ ꯑꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯃꯃꯤꯡ ꯂꯩꯔꯕꯥ ꯑꯦꯟꯇꯤꯇꯤꯒꯤ ꯃꯈꯜ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯂꯦꯄꯊꯣꯀꯄꯗꯥ ꯃꯇꯦꯡ ꯄꯥꯡꯕꯥ ꯉꯃꯗꯦ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯃꯑꯣꯡ ꯑꯃꯠꯇꯗꯥ ꯑꯆꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯅꯠꯔꯒꯥ ꯃꯄꯨꯡ ꯐꯥꯗꯕꯥ ꯑꯣꯏꯗꯦ꯫
For example the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized and named entities often span several words only some of which are capitalized,ꯈꯨꯗꯝ ꯑꯣꯏꯅꯥ ꯋꯥꯍꯩ ꯑꯃꯒꯤ ꯑꯍꯥꯅꯕꯥ ꯑꯛꯁꯔ ꯑꯁꯤꯁꯨ ꯀꯦꯄꯤꯇꯦꯂꯥꯏꯖ ꯇꯧꯏ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯃꯤꯡ ꯊꯣꯅꯕꯥ ꯑꯦꯟꯇꯤꯇꯤꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯑꯌꯥꯝꯕꯅꯥ ꯋꯥꯍꯩ ꯀꯌꯥ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯌꯥꯑꯣꯏ ꯃꯗꯨꯒꯤ ꯃꯅꯨꯡꯗꯥ ꯈꯔꯈꯛꯇꯃꯛ ꯀꯦꯄꯤꯇꯦꯂꯥꯏꯖ ꯇꯧꯏ꯫

Generally there is a tradeoff between bias and variance,ꯃꯍꯧꯁꯥꯅꯥ ꯕꯥꯏꯁ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯚꯦꯔꯤꯑꯦꯟꯁꯀꯤ ꯃꯔꯛꯇꯥ ꯇ꯭ꯔꯦꯗ ꯑꯣꯐ .
A learning algorithm with low bias must be flexible so that it can fit the data well,ꯂꯣ ꯕꯥꯏꯁ ꯂꯩꯕꯥ ꯂꯔꯅꯤꯡ ꯑꯦꯂꯒꯣꯔꯤꯊꯝ ꯑꯃꯅꯥ ꯐ꯭ꯂꯦꯛꯁꯤꯕꯜ ꯑꯣꯏꯒꯗꯕꯅꯤ ꯃꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯗꯦꯇꯥ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯌꯥꯝꯅꯥ ꯐꯖꯅꯥ ꯐꯤꯠ ꯇꯧꯕꯥ ꯉꯃꯒꯅꯤ
But if the learning algorithm is too flexible it will fit each training data set differently and hence have high variance,ꯑꯗꯨꯕꯨ ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯂꯔꯅꯤꯡ ꯑꯦꯂꯒꯣꯔꯤꯊꯝ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯌꯥꯝꯅꯥ ꯐ꯭ꯂꯦꯛꯁꯤꯕꯜ ꯑꯣꯏꯔꯕꯗꯤ ꯃꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯇ꯭ꯔꯦꯅꯤꯡ ꯗꯦꯇꯥ ꯁꯦꯠ ꯈꯨꯗꯤꯡꯃꯛꯇꯥ ꯇꯣꯉꯥꯟꯅꯥ ꯐꯤꯠ ꯑꯣꯏꯒꯅꯤ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯔꯝ ꯑꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯑꯋꯥꯡꯕꯥ ꯚꯦꯔꯤꯑꯦꯟꯁ ꯂꯩꯒꯅꯤ꯫
A key aspect of many supervised learning methods is that they are able to adjust this tradeoff between bias and variance either automatically or by providing a biasvariance parameter that the user can adjust,ꯁꯨꯄꯔꯚꯥꯏꯖ ꯇꯧꯔꯕꯥ ꯂꯔꯅꯤꯡ ꯃꯦꯊꯗ ꯀꯌꯥꯒꯤ ꯃꯔꯨꯑꯣꯏꯕꯥ ꯃꯁꯛ ꯑꯃꯗꯤ ꯃꯈꯣꯌꯅꯥ ꯕꯥꯏꯁ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯚꯦꯔꯤꯑꯦꯟꯁꯀꯤ ꯃꯔꯛꯇꯥ ꯂꯩꯕꯥ ꯇ꯭ꯔꯦꯗ ꯑꯣꯐ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯃꯁꯥ ꯃꯊꯟꯇꯥ ꯅꯠꯠꯔꯒꯥ ꯌꯨꯖꯔꯅꯥ ꯑꯦꯗꯖꯁ꯭ꯠ ꯇꯧꯕꯥ ꯌꯥꯕꯥ ꯕꯥꯏꯁꯚꯦꯔꯤꯑꯦꯟꯁ ꯄꯦꯔꯥꯃꯤꯇꯔ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯄꯤꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯑꯦꯗꯖꯁ꯭ꯠ ꯇꯧꯕꯥ ꯉꯝꯕꯅꯤ꯫
The second issue is of the amount of training data available relative to the complexity of the true function classifier or regression function,ꯑꯅꯤꯁꯨꯕꯥ ꯏꯁꯨ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯇ꯭ꯔꯨ ꯐꯉ꯭ꯀꯁꯟ ꯀ꯭ꯂꯥꯁꯤꯐꯥꯏꯌꯔ ꯅꯠꯔꯒꯥ ꯔꯤꯒ꯭ꯔꯦꯁꯟ ꯐꯉ꯭ꯀꯁꯅꯒꯤ ꯀꯝꯞꯂꯦꯛꯁꯇꯤꯇꯤꯒꯥ ꯆꯥꯡꯗꯝꯅꯕꯗꯥ ꯐꯪꯂꯤꯕꯥ ꯇ꯭ꯔꯦꯅꯤꯡ ꯗꯦꯇꯥꯒꯤ ꯆꯥꯡ ꯑꯗꯨꯒꯤꯅꯤ꯫
If the true function is simple then an inflexible learning algorithm with high bias and low variance will be able to learn it from a small amount of data,ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯆꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯐꯉ꯭ꯀꯁꯟ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯏꯆꯝ ꯆꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯣꯏꯔꯕꯗꯤ ꯑꯋꯥꯡꯕꯥ ꯕꯥꯏꯁ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯂꯣ ꯚꯦꯔꯤꯑꯦꯟꯁ ꯂꯩꯕꯥ ꯏꯅꯐ꯭ꯂꯦꯛꯁꯤꯕꯜ ꯂꯔꯅꯤꯡ ꯑꯦꯂꯒꯣꯔꯤꯊꯝ ꯑꯃꯅꯥ ꯃꯁꯤ ꯑꯄꯤꯀꯄꯥ ꯗꯦꯇꯥ ꯑꯃꯗꯒꯤ ꯇꯝꯕꯥ ꯉꯃꯒꯅꯤ
But if the true function is highly complex e.g. because it involves complex interactions among many different input features and behaves differently in different parts of the input space then the function will only be able to learn with a large amount of training data paired with a flexible learning algorithm with low bias and,ꯑꯗꯨꯕꯨ ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯆꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯐꯉ꯭ꯀꯁꯟ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯌꯥꯝꯅꯥ ꯀꯝꯞꯂꯦꯛꯁ ꯑꯣꯏꯔꯕꯗꯤ ꯈꯨꯗꯝ ꯑꯣꯏꯅꯥ ꯌꯨ.ꯑꯦꯁ.

A third issue is the dimensionality of the input space,ꯑꯍꯨꯃꯁꯨꯕꯥ ꯋꯥꯐꯝ ꯑꯃꯅꯥ ꯏꯅꯄꯨꯠ ꯁ꯭ꯄꯦꯁꯀꯤ ꯗꯥꯏꯃꯦꯟꯁꯟ ꯑꯁꯤꯅꯤ .
If the input feature vectors have large dimensions learning the function can be difficult even if the true function only depends on a small number of those features,"ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯏꯅꯄꯨꯠ ꯐꯤꯆꯔ ꯚꯦꯛꯇꯔꯁꯤꯡꯅꯥ ꯑꯆꯧꯕꯥ ꯗꯥꯏꯃꯦꯟꯁꯟ ꯂꯩꯔꯕꯗꯤ ꯐꯉ꯭ꯀꯁꯟ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯇꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯑꯔꯨꯕꯥ ꯑꯣꯏꯕꯥ ꯌꯥꯏ, ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯆꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯐꯉ꯭ꯀꯁꯟ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯈꯛꯇꯃꯛ ꯐꯤꯆꯔꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯗꯨꯒꯤ ꯑꯄꯤꯀꯄꯥ ꯃꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯃꯈꯛꯇꯗꯥ ꯃꯈꯥ ꯄꯣꯜꯂꯤ"
This is because the many extra dimensions can confuse the learning algorithm and cause it to have high variance,ꯃꯁꯤꯒꯤ ꯃꯔꯃꯗꯤ ꯑꯍꯦꯅꯕꯥ ꯗꯥꯏꯃꯦꯟꯁꯟ ꯀꯌꯥ ꯑꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯂꯔꯅꯤꯡ ꯑꯦꯂꯒꯣꯔꯤꯊꯝ ꯑꯁꯤꯕꯨ ꯂꯥꯟꯅꯥ ꯂꯃꯖꯤꯡꯕꯥ ꯉꯃꯒꯅꯤ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯁꯤꯗꯥ ꯑꯋꯥꯡꯕꯥ ꯚꯦꯔꯤꯑꯦꯟꯁ ꯂꯩꯍꯅꯕꯥ ꯉꯃꯒꯅꯤ꯫

If the desired output values are often incorrect because of human error or sensor errors then the learning algorithm should not attempt to find a function that exactly matches the training examples,ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯄꯥꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯥꯎꯇꯄꯨꯠ ꯚꯦꯜꯌꯨꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯑꯌꯥꯝꯕꯅꯥ ꯃꯤꯑꯣꯏꯕꯒꯤ ꯑꯁꯣꯌꯕꯥ ꯅꯠꯠꯔꯒꯥ ꯁꯦꯟꯁꯔꯒꯤ ꯑꯁꯣꯌꯕꯥ ꯂꯩꯕꯅꯥ ꯃꯔꯝ ꯑꯣꯏꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯑꯔꯥꯅꯕꯥ ꯑꯣꯏꯔꯕꯗꯤ ꯂꯔꯅꯤꯡ ꯑꯦꯂꯒꯣꯔꯤꯊꯝ ꯑꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯇ꯭ꯔꯦꯅꯤꯡꯒꯤ ꯈꯨꯗꯃꯁꯤꯡꯒꯥ ꯃꯥꯟꯅꯅꯥ ꯂꯧꯕꯥ ꯐꯉ꯭ꯀꯁꯟ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯊꯤꯅꯕꯥ ꯍꯣꯠꯅꯔꯣꯏꯗꯕꯅꯤ
