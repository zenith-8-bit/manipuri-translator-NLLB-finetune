But because of what would later be called quantum entanglement measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object no matter how far away it is,ꯑꯗꯨꯕꯨ ꯃꯇꯨꯡ ꯇꯥꯔꯀꯄꯗꯥ ꯀ꯭ꯕꯥꯟꯇꯝ ꯑꯦꯟꯇꯦꯡꯒꯂꯃꯦꯟꯇ ꯍꯥꯌꯅꯥ ꯀꯧꯕꯥ ꯄꯣꯠꯁꯛ ꯑꯃꯅꯥ ꯃꯔꯝ ꯑꯣꯏꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯄꯣꯠꯁꯛ ꯑꯃꯕꯨ ꯃꯥꯄꯜ ꯑꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯑꯇꯣꯞꯄꯥ ꯄꯣꯠꯁꯛ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯀꯌꯥ ꯌꯥꯝꯅꯥ ꯂꯥꯞꯅꯥ ꯂꯩꯔꯕꯁꯨ ꯐꯣꯡꯗꯣꯛꯂꯤꯕꯥ ꯋꯦꯕꯐꯪꯁꯟ ꯑꯗꯨꯒꯤ ꯈꯨꯗꯛꯇꯥ ꯑꯍꯣꯡꯕꯥ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯄꯨꯔꯛꯀꯅꯤ

Because the true physical condition of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first Einstein concluded the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition only an incomplete description of it,ꯃꯔꯃꯗꯤ ꯑꯅꯤꯁꯨꯕꯥ ꯄꯣꯠꯁꯛ ꯑꯗꯨꯒꯤ ꯑꯆꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯐꯤꯖꯤꯀꯦꯜ ꯀꯟꯗꯤꯁꯟ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯑꯍꯥꯅꯕꯥ ꯑꯥꯏꯟꯁꯇꯤꯅꯗꯥ ꯇꯧꯈꯤꯕꯥ ꯑꯦꯛꯁꯟ ꯑꯃꯅꯥ ꯈꯨꯗꯛꯇꯥ ꯍꯣꯡꯗꯣꯀꯄꯥ ꯉꯃꯗꯕꯅꯥ ꯃꯔꯝ ꯑꯣꯏꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯋꯦꯕꯐꯪꯁꯟ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯑꯆꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯐꯤꯖꯤꯀꯦꯜ ꯀꯟꯗꯤꯁꯟ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯃꯄꯨꯡ ꯐꯥꯗꯕꯥ ꯃꯁꯛ ꯈꯉꯗꯣꯀꯄꯥ ꯈꯛꯇꯃꯛ ꯑꯣꯏꯕꯥ ꯌꯥꯔꯣꯏ꯫
A more famous version of this argument came in 1935 when Einstein published a paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox,ꯋꯥꯐꯝ ꯑꯁꯤꯒꯤ ꯍꯦꯟꯅꯥ ꯃꯃꯤꯡ ꯆꯠꯄꯥ ꯚꯔꯖꯟ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯱꯹꯳꯵ꯗꯥ ꯂꯥꯀꯈꯤ ꯃꯗꯨꯗꯤ ꯑꯥꯏꯟꯁꯇꯤꯅꯅꯥ ꯕꯣꯔꯤꯁ ꯄꯣꯗꯣꯂꯁ꯭ꯀꯤ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯅꯥꯊꯟ ꯔꯣꯁꯦꯅꯒꯥ ꯂꯣꯌꯅꯅꯥ ꯄꯦꯄꯔ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯐꯣꯡꯈꯤ ꯃꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯏ.ꯄꯤ.ꯑꯥꯔ.
In this thought experiment two particles interact in such a way that the wavefunction describing them is entangled,ꯋꯥꯈꯜꯂꯣꯟ ꯑꯁꯤꯒꯤ ꯑꯦꯛꯁꯄꯔꯤꯃꯦꯟꯇ ꯑꯁꯤꯗꯥ ꯄꯥꯔꯇꯤꯀꯜ ꯑꯅꯤꯅꯥ ꯃꯈꯣꯌꯕꯨ ꯐꯣꯡꯗꯣꯛꯂꯤꯕꯥ ꯋꯦꯕꯐꯪꯛꯁꯟ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯑꯦꯟꯇꯔꯜ ꯇꯧꯕꯥ ꯃꯑꯣꯡꯗꯥ ꯏꯟꯇꯔꯦꯛꯇ ꯇꯧꯏ .
Then no matter how far the two particles were separated a precise position measurement on one particle would imply the ability to predict perfectly the result of measuring the position of the other particle,ꯃꯗꯨꯒꯤ ꯃꯇꯨꯡꯗꯥ ꯄꯥꯔꯇꯤꯀꯜ ꯑꯅꯤ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯀꯌꯥ ꯌꯥꯝꯅꯥ ꯂꯥꯞꯅꯥ ꯇꯣꯉꯥꯟꯅꯥ ꯊꯝꯂꯕꯁꯨ ꯄꯥꯔꯇꯤꯀꯜ ꯑꯃꯗꯥ ꯑꯀꯛꯅꯕꯥ ꯄꯣꯖꯤꯁꯟ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯃꯥꯄꯂꯅꯤ ꯍꯥꯌꯕꯁꯤ ꯑꯇꯣꯞꯄꯥ ꯄꯥꯔꯇꯤꯀꯜ ꯑꯃꯒꯤ ꯄꯣꯖꯤꯁꯟ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯃꯥꯄꯂꯒꯤ ꯐꯜ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯃꯄꯨꯡ ꯐꯥꯅꯥ ꯂꯥꯎꯊꯣꯀꯄꯥ ꯉꯝꯕꯒꯤ ꯃꯄꯥꯉ꯭ꯒꯜ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯇꯥꯛꯀꯅꯤ
Likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in an equally precise prediction for of the momentum of the other particle without needing to disturb the other particle in any way,ꯃꯇꯧ ꯑꯁꯨꯝꯅꯥ ꯄꯥꯔꯇꯤꯀꯜ ꯑꯃꯒꯤ ꯑꯀꯛꯅꯕꯥ ꯃꯣꯃꯦꯟꯇꯝ ꯃꯥꯄꯂꯅꯥ ꯑꯇꯣꯞꯄꯥ ꯄꯥꯔꯇꯤꯀꯜ ꯑꯃꯒꯤ ꯃꯣꯃꯦꯟꯇꯝ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯃꯑꯣꯡ ꯑꯃꯠꯇꯗꯥ ꯁꯣꯀꯍꯟꯗꯅꯕꯥ ꯃꯊꯧ ꯇꯥꯗꯅꯥ ꯆꯞ ꯃꯥꯟꯅꯕꯥ ꯑꯀꯛꯅꯕꯥ ꯄ꯭ꯔꯤꯗꯤꯛꯁꯟ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯊꯣꯀꯍꯅꯒꯅꯤ

They invoked a principle later known as the EPR criterion of reality positing that If without in any way disturbing a system we can predict with certainty i.e. with probability equal to unity the value of a physical quantity then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity,ꯃꯈꯣꯌꯅꯥ ꯃꯇꯨꯡꯗꯥ ꯏ.ꯄꯤ.ꯑꯥꯔ.
From this they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured,ꯃꯁꯤꯗꯒꯤ ꯃꯈꯣꯌꯅꯥ ꯑꯅꯤꯁꯨꯕꯥ ꯄꯥꯔꯇꯤꯀꯜ ꯑꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯃꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯃꯍꯦꯛꯇꯒꯤ ꯃꯥꯄꯂꯒꯤ ꯃꯃꯥꯡꯗꯥ ꯄꯣꯖꯤꯁꯟ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯣꯃꯦꯟꯇꯝ ꯑꯅꯤꯃꯛꯀꯤ ꯂꯦꯞꯄꯥ ꯂꯩꯇꯕꯥ ꯚꯦꯜꯌꯨ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯂꯩꯒꯗꯕꯅꯤ ꯍꯥꯌꯅꯥ ꯂꯧꯈꯤ꯫
But quantum mechanics considers these two observables incompatible and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both to any system,ꯑꯗꯨꯕꯨ ꯀ꯭ꯕꯥꯟꯇꯝ ꯃꯦꯀꯥꯅꯤꯛꯁꯅꯥ ꯑꯣꯕꯖꯥꯔꯕꯦꯕꯜ ꯑꯅꯤ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯏꯅꯀꯃꯄꯦꯇꯤꯕ ꯑꯣꯏꯗꯦ ꯍꯥꯌꯅꯥ ꯂꯧꯏ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯔꯝ ꯑꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯑꯅꯤꯃꯛꯀꯤ ꯑꯣꯏꯅꯥ ꯁꯤꯃꯨꯂꯇꯦꯟ ꯚꯦꯜꯌꯨꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯁꯤꯁ꯭ꯇꯦꯝ ꯑꯃꯠꯇꯗꯥ ꯃꯔꯤ ꯂꯩꯅꯗꯦ

In 1964 John Stewart Bell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further,꯱꯹꯶꯴ꯗꯥ ꯖꯣꯟ ꯁ꯭ꯇꯦꯋꯥꯔꯗ ꯕꯦꯂꯅꯥ ꯀ꯭ꯕꯥꯟꯇꯝ ꯑꯦꯟꯇꯥꯡꯒꯂꯃꯦꯟꯇꯀꯤ ꯑꯦꯅꯥꯂꯥꯏꯁꯤꯁ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯌꯥꯝꯅꯥ ꯃꯈꯥ ꯇꯥꯅꯥ ꯄꯨꯈꯤ
He deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated,ꯃꯍꯥꯛꯅꯥ ꯊꯤꯖꯤꯅꯈꯤ ꯃꯗꯨꯗꯤ ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯃꯥꯏꯄꯥꯀꯄꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯑꯦꯟꯇꯦꯡꯒ꯭ꯂꯦꯗ ꯄꯦꯔꯥ ꯑꯃꯒꯤ ꯇꯣꯉꯥꯅꯕꯥ ꯄꯥꯔꯇꯤꯀꯜ ꯑꯅꯤꯗꯥ ꯃꯁꯥ ꯃꯊꯟꯇꯥ ꯄꯥꯡꯊꯣꯛꯂꯕꯗꯤ ꯃꯗꯨꯒꯤ ꯃꯍꯩꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯍꯥꯐ ꯈꯨꯗꯤꯡꯃꯛꯀꯤ ꯃꯅꯨꯡꯗꯥ ꯂꯣꯠꯁꯤꯜꯂꯕꯥ ꯚꯦꯔꯤꯑꯦꯕꯂꯁꯤꯡꯗꯥ ꯃꯈꯥ ꯄꯣꯜꯂꯤ ꯍꯥꯌꯅꯥ ꯂꯧꯕꯅꯥ ꯃꯥꯏꯖꯔꯤꯡ ꯑꯅꯤ ꯑꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯂꯩꯔꯤꯕꯥ ꯑꯥꯎꯠꯀꯃꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯀꯔꯝꯅꯥ ꯀꯣꯔꯤꯂꯦꯇꯦꯗ ꯑꯣꯏꯕꯒꯦ ꯍꯥꯌꯕꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯃꯦꯊꯃꯦꯇꯤꯀꯦꯜ ꯀꯟꯠꯔꯣꯜ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯄꯤꯔꯤ
This constraint would later be called a Bell inequality,ꯃꯁꯤꯒꯤ ꯑꯊꯤꯡꯕꯥ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯃꯇꯨꯡꯗꯥ ꯕꯦꯜ ꯏꯅꯛꯂꯨꯁꯤꯕ ꯍꯥꯌꯅꯥ ꯀꯧꯒꯅꯤ .
Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality,ꯃꯗꯨꯒꯤ ꯃꯇꯨꯡꯗꯥ ꯕꯦꯂꯅꯥ ꯀ꯭ꯕꯥꯟꯇꯝ ꯐꯤꯖꯤꯛꯁꯅꯥ ꯃꯁꯤꯒꯤ ꯃꯥꯟꯅꯕꯥ ꯂꯩꯇꯕꯥ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯊꯨꯒꯥꯏꯕꯥ ꯀꯣꯔꯤꯑꯦꯂꯁꯤꯡ ꯂꯥꯎꯊꯣꯀꯏ ꯍꯥꯌꯕꯥ ꯎꯠꯈꯤ꯫
Consequently the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are nonlocal which is to say that somehow the two particles are able to interact instantaneously no matter how widely they ever become separated,ꯃꯔꯝ ꯑꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯂꯣꯠꯁꯤꯜꯂꯕꯥ ꯚꯦꯔꯤꯑꯦꯕꯂꯁꯤꯡꯅꯥ ꯀ꯭ꯕꯥꯟꯇꯝ ꯐꯤꯖꯤꯛꯁꯀꯤ ꯄ꯭ꯔꯤꯗꯤꯛꯁꯅꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯃꯌꯦꯛ ꯁꯦꯡꯅꯥ ꯇꯥꯀꯄꯥ ꯉꯝꯕꯒꯤ ꯑꯃꯠꯇꯥ ꯉꯥꯏꯔꯕꯥ ꯄꯥꯝꯕꯩꯗꯤ ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯃꯈꯣꯌ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯅꯟ-ꯂꯣꯀꯦꯜ ꯑꯣꯏꯔꯕꯗꯤ ꯃꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯃꯑꯣꯡ ꯑꯃꯗꯥ ꯄꯥꯔꯇꯤꯀꯜ ꯑꯅꯤ ꯑꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯀꯌꯥ ꯌꯥꯝꯅꯥ ꯄꯥꯛ ꯁꯟꯅꯥ ​​ꯇꯣꯉꯥꯟꯅꯥ ꯂꯩꯔꯕꯁꯨ ꯈꯨꯗꯛꯇꯥ ꯏꯟꯇꯔꯦꯛꯇ ꯇꯧꯕꯥ ꯉꯝꯃꯤ ꯍꯥꯌꯕꯁꯤꯅꯤ
