In January 1902 the German Assyriologist Friedrich Delitzsch gave a lecture at the SingAkademie zu Berlin before the Kaiser and his wife in which he argued that the Flood story in the Book of Genesis was directly copied from the Epic of Gilgamesh,ꯖꯅꯨꯋꯥꯔꯤ ꯱꯹꯰꯲ꯗꯥ ꯖꯔꯃꯅꯤꯒꯤ ꯑꯦꯁꯤꯔꯤꯑꯣꯂꯣꯖꯤꯁ꯭ꯠ ꯐ꯭ꯔꯤꯗꯔꯤꯆ ꯗꯦꯂꯤꯠꯖꯆꯅꯥ ꯀꯥꯏꯁꯥꯔ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯍꯥꯛꯀꯤ ꯂꯣꯌꯅꯕꯤꯒꯤ ꯃꯃꯥꯡꯗꯥ ꯁꯤꯉ꯭ꯒꯥꯀꯥꯗꯦꯃꯤ ꯖꯨ ꯕꯔꯂꯤꯟꯗꯥ ꯂꯦꯀꯆꯔ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯄꯤꯈꯤ ꯃꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯃꯍꯥꯛꯅꯥ ꯍꯥꯌꯈꯤ ꯃꯗꯨꯗꯤ ꯖꯦꯅꯦꯁꯤꯁꯀꯤ ꯂꯥꯏꯔꯤꯛ ꯑꯁꯤꯗꯥ ꯌꯥꯑꯣꯔꯤꯕꯥ ꯏꯁꯤꯡ ꯏꯆꯥꯎꯒꯤ ꯋꯥꯔꯤ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯒꯤꯂꯒꯥꯃꯦꯁꯀꯤ ꯏꯄꯤꯛ ꯑꯁꯤꯗꯒꯤ ꯍꯀꯊꯦꯡꯅꯅꯥ ꯀꯣꯄꯤ ꯇꯧꯈꯤꯕꯅꯤ꯫
Delitzschs lecture was so controversial that by September 1903 he had managed to collect thousands of articles and pamphlets criticizing this lecture about the Flood and another about the relationship between the Code of Hammurabi and the biblical Law of Moses,ꯗꯦꯂꯤꯠꯁꯆꯁꯀꯤ ꯂꯦꯀꯆꯔ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯑꯁꯨꯛ ꯌꯥꯝꯅꯥ ꯋꯥꯅꯥ ꯊꯣꯀꯈꯤ ꯃꯗꯨꯗꯤ ꯁꯦꯞꯇꯦꯝꯕꯔ ꯱꯹꯰꯳ ꯐꯥꯑꯣꯕꯗꯥ ꯃꯍꯥꯛꯅꯥ ꯏꯆꯥꯎꯒꯤ ꯃꯇꯥꯡꯗꯥ ꯂꯦꯀꯆꯔ ꯑꯁꯤꯒꯤ ꯃꯇꯥꯡꯗꯥ ꯋꯥꯐꯝ ꯀꯌꯥ ꯊꯃꯈꯤꯕꯥ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯑꯇꯣꯞꯄꯥ ꯑꯃꯅꯥ ꯍꯃꯨꯔꯥꯕꯤ ꯀꯣꯗ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯣꯁꯦꯁꯀꯤ ꯕꯥꯏꯕꯂꯒꯤ ꯑꯥꯏꯅꯒꯤ ꯃꯔꯛꯇꯥ ꯂꯩꯔꯤꯕꯥ ꯃꯔꯤ ꯑꯁꯤꯒꯤ ꯃꯇꯥꯡꯗꯥ ꯑꯇꯣꯞꯄꯥ ꯋꯥꯐꯝ ꯀꯌꯥ ꯈꯣꯃꯖꯤꯅꯕꯥ ꯉꯃꯈꯤ꯫

On the other hand some scholars argue that linguistic palaeographical handwriting metrical poetic structure and onomastic naming considerations align to support a date of composition in the first half of the 8th century in particular the poems apparent observation of etymological vowellength distinctions in unstressed syllables described by Kaluzas law has been thought to demonstrate a date of composition prior,"ꯑꯃꯔꯣꯃꯗꯥ ꯁ꯭ꯀꯣꯂꯥꯔ ꯈꯔꯅꯥ ꯍꯥꯌꯔꯤ ꯃꯗꯨꯗꯤ ꯂꯤꯉ꯭ꯒꯨꯏꯁ꯭ꯇꯤꯛ ꯄꯦꯂꯦꯑꯣꯒ꯭ꯔꯥꯐꯤꯛ ꯍꯦꯟꯗꯔꯥꯏꯇꯤꯡ ꯃꯦꯠꯔꯤꯀꯦꯜ ꯄꯣꯏꯇꯤꯛ ꯁ꯭ꯠꯔꯀꯆꯔ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯑꯣꯅꯣꯃꯥꯁ꯭ꯇꯤꯛ ꯅꯦꯃꯤꯡ ꯀꯟꯗꯤꯁꯅꯁꯤꯡꯅꯥ ꯃꯔꯨ ꯑꯣꯏꯅꯥ ꯸ꯁꯨꯕꯥ ꯆꯍꯤꯆꯥꯒꯤ ꯑꯍꯥꯅꯕꯥ ꯁꯔꯨꯛ ꯑꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯀꯝꯄꯣꯖꯤꯁꯅꯒꯤ ꯇꯥꯡ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯁꯄꯣꯔꯠ ꯇꯧꯅꯕꯥ ꯑꯦꯂꯥꯏꯟ ꯇꯧꯏ ꯃꯗꯨꯗꯤ ꯀꯥꯂꯨꯖꯥꯁ ꯂꯣꯅꯥ ꯇꯥꯀꯄꯥ ꯑꯅꯁ꯭ꯠꯔꯦꯁ ꯁꯤꯂꯦꯕꯂꯁꯤꯡꯗꯥ ꯏꯇꯤꯃꯣꯂꯣꯖꯤꯀꯦꯜ ꯚꯣꯋꯦꯂꯦꯡꯊꯀꯤ ꯈꯦꯠꯅꯕꯥ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯃꯌꯦꯛ ꯁꯦꯡꯅꯥ ꯎꯕꯥ ꯐꯪꯏ, ꯃꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯀꯝꯄꯣꯖꯤꯁꯟ ꯄ꯭ꯔꯥꯏꯑꯣꯔꯤꯇꯤꯒꯤ ꯇꯥꯡ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯎꯠꯅꯕꯥ ꯋꯥꯈꯜ ꯈꯅꯈꯤ꯫"

However scholars disagree about whether the metrical phenomena described by Kaluzas law prove an early date of composition or are evidence of a longer prehistory of the Beowulf metre B.R.

In 1914 the Swedish folklorist Carl Wilhelm von Sydow made a strong argument for parallelism with The Hand and the Child because the folktale type demonstrated a monstrous arm motif that corresponded with Beowulfs wrenching off Grendels arm,꯱꯹꯱꯴ꯗꯥ ꯁ꯭ꯕꯤꯗꯦꯅꯒꯤ ꯐꯣꯜꯀꯂꯣꯔꯤꯁ꯭ꯠ ꯀꯥꯔꯜ ꯋꯤꯂꯍꯦꯝ ꯚꯣꯟ ꯁꯥꯏꯗꯣꯅꯥ ꯈꯨꯠ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯑꯉꯥꯡꯒꯥ ꯄꯦꯔꯥꯂꯦꯂꯤꯖꯃꯒꯤ ꯃꯇꯥꯡꯗꯥ ꯑꯀꯅꯕꯥ ꯋꯥꯐꯝ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯊꯃꯈꯤ ꯃꯔꯃꯗꯤ ꯐꯣꯜꯀꯇꯦꯜ ꯃꯈꯜ ꯑꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯒ꯭ꯔꯦꯟꯗꯦꯂꯁ ꯑꯥꯔꯃꯒꯤ ꯔꯦꯟꯆꯤꯡꯒꯥ ꯃꯥꯟꯅꯕꯥ ꯑꯉꯀꯄꯥ ꯑꯥꯔꯝ ꯃꯣꯇꯤꯐ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯎꯠꯈꯤ꯫
