Rather the British government remained firm in its view that the imposition of sanctions would be unconstitutional because we do not accept that this situation in South Africa constitutes a threat to international peace and security and we do not in any case believe that sanctions would have the effect of persuading the South African Government to change its policies,ꯃꯗꯨꯒꯤ ꯃꯍꯨꯠꯇꯥ ꯕ꯭ꯔꯤꯇꯤꯁ ꯁꯔꯀꯥꯔꯅꯥ ꯁꯦꯉ꯭ꯀꯁꯅꯁꯤꯡ ꯊꯥꯗꯣꯀꯄꯥ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯀꯟꯁꯇꯤꯠꯌꯨꯁꯅꯒꯤ ꯃꯇꯨꯡ ꯏꯟꯅꯥ ꯆꯠꯅꯔꯣꯏ ꯍꯥꯌꯅꯥ ꯂꯦꯞꯄꯥ ꯂꯩꯇꯅꯥ ꯂꯦꯄꯈꯤ ꯃꯔꯃꯗꯤ ꯑꯩꯈꯣꯌꯅꯥ ꯈꯥ ꯑꯐ꯭ꯔꯤꯀꯥꯒꯤ ꯐꯤꯚꯝ ꯑꯁꯤꯅꯥ ꯏꯟꯇꯔꯅꯦꯁ꯭ꯅꯦꯜ ꯁꯥꯟꯇꯤ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯁꯦꯛꯌꯨꯔꯤꯇꯤꯗꯥ ꯆꯩꯊꯦꯡ ꯑꯃꯥ ꯄꯤꯔꯤ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯁꯦꯉ꯭ꯀꯁꯅꯁꯤꯡꯅꯥ ꯈꯥ ꯑꯐ꯭ꯔꯤꯀꯥꯒꯤ ꯁꯔꯀꯥꯔꯗꯥ ꯃꯁꯤꯒꯤ ꯄꯣꯂꯤꯁꯤꯁꯤꯡ ꯍꯣꯡꯗꯣꯛꯅꯕꯥ ꯋꯥꯔꯦꯞ ꯂꯧꯕꯒꯤ ꯏꯐꯦꯛꯇ ꯂꯩꯒꯅꯤ ꯍꯥꯌꯅꯥ ꯑꯩꯈꯣꯌꯅꯥ ꯊꯥꯖꯗꯦ ꯃꯗꯨꯗꯤ ꯑꯩꯈꯣꯌꯅꯥ ꯌꯥꯗꯦ꯫
